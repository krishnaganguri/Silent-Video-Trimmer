# Silent Video Trimmer

A simple web tool that allows users to upload a video, trim it to a specified start and end time, and then download the trimmed video. This tool uses **FFmpeg.js** to process video trimming directly in the browser without any server-side processing.

- **Time Selection**: The start and end times for trimming can be selected using a slider (in HH:MM:SS format).
- **Preview**: A video preview allows users to see the part of the video that will be trimmed.
- **File Size Validation**: Ensures that video files are not too large (maximum 50MB).
- **Trim Video**: Videos are trimmed directly in the browser using FFmpeg.js.
- **Download**: The trimmed video is available for download.
